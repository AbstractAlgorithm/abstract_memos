notes:

- chaotic dynamics
- fractals
- Newton
- patterns emerging through Foruier series and diffusion
- plant growth via microtubuli emergent self-organization via rules for direction and boundary conditions
- reductionism vs emergence (reversibility of experiments)
- consciousness (arousal, orientation, detection, execution)
