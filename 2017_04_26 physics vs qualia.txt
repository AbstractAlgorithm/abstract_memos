What if our physics is dependent on qualia, instead of qualia's description being dependent on physics?

Chicken and egg problem - which is more fundamental, and which is build on top of which, the qualia of laws of math and phyics?

Maybe laws are objective and fundamental and our qualia only exists within it, ooorrrr.... the laws and processes that we see and model are such because of our qualia. And more objective system than these "subjective" laws of nature exist perhaps. Our physics could be consequence of our qualia, which is a consequence of another, objective physics that could potentially be out of our reach.
